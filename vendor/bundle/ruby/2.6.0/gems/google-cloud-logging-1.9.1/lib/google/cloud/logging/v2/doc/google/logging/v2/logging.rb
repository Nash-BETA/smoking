      # The parameters to DeleteLog.
      # @!attribute [rw] log_name
      #   @return [String]
      #     Required. The resource name of the log to delete:
      #
      #         "projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
      #         "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"

      #         "folders/[FOLDER_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
      #
      #     `[LOG_ID]` must be URL-encoded. For example,
      #     `"projects/my-project-id/logs/syslog"`,
      #     `"organizations/1234567890/logs/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Factivity"`.
      #     For more information about log names, see
      #     {Google::Logging::V2::LogEntry LogEntry}.

      # The parameters to WriteLogEntries.
      # @!attribute [rw] log_name
      #   @return [String]
      #     Optional. A default log resource name that is assigned to all log entries
      #     in `entries` that do not specify a value for `log_name`:
      #
      #         "projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
      #         "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
      #         "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
      #         "folders/[FOLDER_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
      #
      #     `[LOG_ID]` must be URL-encoded. For example:
      #
      #         "projects/my-project-id/logs/syslog"
      #         "organizations/1234567890/logs/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Factivity"
      #
      #     The permission <code>logging.logEntries.create</code> is needed on each
      #     project, organization, billing account, or folder that is receiving
      #     new log entries, whether the resource is specified in
      #     <code>logName</code> or in an individual log entry.
      # @!attribute [rw] resource
      #   @return [Google::Api::MonitoredResource]
      #     Optional. A default monitored resource object that is assigned to all log
      #     entries in `entries` that do not specify a value for `resource`. Example:
      #
      #         { "type": "gce_instance",
      #           "labels": {
      #             "zone": "us-central1-a", "instance_id": "00000000000000000000" }}
      #
      #     See {Google::Logging::V2::LogEntry LogEntry}.
      # @!attribute [rw] labels
      #   @return [Hash{String => String}]
      #     Optional. Default labels that are added to the `labels` field of all log
      #     entries in `entries`. If a log entry already has a label with the same key
      #     as a label in this parameter, then the log entry's label is not changed.
      #     See {Google::Logging::V2::LogEntry LogEntry}.
      # @!attribute [rw] entries
      #   @return [Array<Google::Logging::V2::LogEntry>]
      #     Required. The log entries to send to Logging. The order of log
      #     entries in this list does not matter. Values supplied in this method's
      #     `log_name`, `resource`, and `labels` fields are copied into those log
      #     entries in this list that do not include values for their corresponding
      #     fields. For more information, see the
      #     {Google::Logging::V2::LogEntry LogEntry} type.
      #
      #     If the `timestamp` or `insert_id` fields are missing in log entries, then
      #     this method supplies the current time or a unique identifier, respectively.
      #     The supplied values are chosen so that, among the log entries that did not
      #     supply their own values, the entries earlier in the list will sort before
      #     the entries later in the list. See the `entries.list` method.
      #
      #     Log entries with timestamps that are more than the
      #     [logs retention period](https://cloud.google.com/logging/quota-policy) in the past or more than
      #     24 hours in the future will not be available when calling `entries.list`.
      #     However, those log entries can still be
      #     [exported with LogSinks](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs).
      #
      #     To improve throughput and to avoid exceeding the
      #     [quota limit](https://cloud.google.com/logging/quota-policy) for calls to `entries.write`,
      #     you should try to include several log entries in this list,
      #     rather than calling this method for each individual log entry.
      # @!attribute [rw] partial_success
      #   @return [true, false]
      #     Optional. Whether valid entries should be written even if some other
      #     entries fail due to INVALID_ARGUMENT or PERMISSION_DENIED errors. If any
      #     entry is not written, then the response status is the error associated
      #     with one of the failed entries and the response includes error details
      #     keyed by the entries' zero-based index in the `entries.write` method.
      # @!attribute [rw] dry_run
      #   @return [true, false]
      #     Optional. If true, the request should expect normal response, but the
      #     entries won't be persisted nor exported. Useful for checking whether the
      #     logging API endpoints are working properly before sending valuable data.

      # The parameters to `ListLogEntries`.
      # @!attribute [rw] project_ids
      #   @return [Array<String>]
      #     Deprecated. Use `resource_names` instead.  One or more project identifiers
      #     or project numbers from which to retrieve log entries.  Example:
      #     `"my-project-1A"`.
      # @!attribute [rw] resource_names
      #   @return [Array<String>]
      #     Required. Names of one or more parent resources from which to
      #     retrieve log entries:
      #
      #         "projects/[PROJECT_ID]"
      #         "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]"
      #         "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]"
      #         "folders/[FOLDER_ID]"
      #
      #
      #     Projects listed in the `project_ids` field are added to this list.
      # @!attribute [rw] filter
      #   @return [String]
      #     Optional. A filter that chooses which log entries to return.  See [Advanced
      #     Logs Filters](/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters).  Only log entries that
      #     match the filter are returned.  An empty filter matches all log entries in
      #     the resources listed in `resource_names`. Referencing a parent resource
      #     that is not listed in `resource_names` will cause the filter to return no
      #     results.
      #     The maximum length of the filter is 20000 characters.
      # @!attribute [rw] order_by
      #   @return [String]
      #     Optional. How the results should be sorted.  Presently, the only permitted
      #     values are `"timestamp asc"` (default) and `"timestamp desc"`. The first
      #     option returns entries in order of increasing values of
      #     `LogEntry.timestamp` (oldest first), and the second option returns entries
      #     in order of decreasing timestamps (newest first).  Entries with equal
      #     timestamps are returned in order of their `insert_id` values.
      # @!attribute [rw] page_size
      #   @return [Integer]
      #     Optional. The maximum number of results to return from this request.
      #     Non-positive values are ignored.  The presence of `next_page_token` in the
      #     response indicates that more results might be available.
      # @!attribute [rw] page_token
      #   @return [String]
      #     Optional. If present, then retrieve the next batch of results from the
      #     preceding call to this method.  `page_token` must be the value of
      #     `next_page_token` from the previous response.  The values of other method
      #     parameters should be identical to those in the previous call.
      class ListLogEntriesRequest; end

      # Result returned from `ListLogEntries`.
      # @!attribute [rw] entries
      #   @return [Array<Google::Logging::V2::LogEntry>]
      #     A list of log entries.  If `entries` is empty, `nextPageToken` may still be
      #     returned, indicating that more entries may exist.  See `nextPageToken` for
      #     more information.
      # @!attribute [rw] next_page_token
      #   @return [String]
      #     If there might be more results than those appearing in this response, then
      #     `nextPageToken` is included.  To get the next set of results, call this
      #     method again using the value of `nextPageToken` as `pageToken`.
      #
      #     If a value for `next_page_token` appears and the `entries` field is empty,
      #     it means that the search found no log entries so far but it did not have
      #     time to search all the possible log entries.  Retry the method with this
      #     value for `page_token` to continue the search.  Alternatively, consider
      #     speeding up the search by changing your filter to specify a single log name
      #     or resource type, or to narrow the time range of the search.
