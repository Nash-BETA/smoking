    # # AsyncActor
    #
    # @private An module that provides a class asynchronous capability when
    #   included. It can create a child thread to run background jobs, and
    #   help make sure the child thread terminates properly when process
    #   is interrupted.
    #
    # To use AsyncActor, the classes that are including this module need to
    # define a run_backgrounder method that does the background job. The
    # classes can then control the child thread job through instance methods
    # like async_start, async_stop, etc.
    #
    # @example
    #   class Foo
    #     include AsyncActor
    #
    #     def initialize
    #       super()
    #     end
    #
    #     def run_backgrounder
    #       # run async job
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   foo = Foo.new
    #   foo.async_start
