    # # Ruby Client for Stackdriver Trace API ([Alpha](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-ruby#versioning))
    #
    # [Stackdriver Trace API][Product Documentation]:
    # Sends application trace data to Stackdriver Trace for viewing. Trace data is
    # collected for all App Engine applications by default. Trace data from other
    # applications can be provided using this API.
    # - [Product Documentation][]
    #
    # ## Quick Start
    # In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following
    # steps:
    #
    # 1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
    # 2. [Enable billing for your project.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project)
    # 3. [Enable the Stackdriver Trace API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/trace)
    # 4. [Setup Authentication.](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-trace/latest/file.AUTHENTICATION.html)
    #
    # ### Preview
    # #### TraceServiceClient
    # ```rb
    # require "google/cloud/trace/v2"
    #
    # trace_service_client = Google::Cloud::Trace::V2.new
    # formatted_name = Google::Cloud::Trace::V2::TraceServiceClient.project_path(project_id)
    # spans = []
    # trace_service_client.batch_write_spans(formatted_name, spans)
    # ```
    #
    # ### Next Steps
    # - Read the [Stackdriver Trace API Product documentation][Product Documentation]
    #   to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.
    # - View this [repository's main README](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/README.md)
    #   to see the full list of Cloud APIs that we cover.

        # This file describes an API for collecting and viewing traces and spans
        # within a trace.  A Trace is a collection of spans corresponding to a single
        # operation or set of operations for an application. A span is an individual
        # timed event which forms a node of the trace tree. A single trace may
        # contain span(s) from multiple services.
        #
        # @param credentials [Google::Auth::Credentials, String, Hash, GRPC::Core::Channel, GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials, Proc]
        #   Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client. This parameter can
        #   be many types.
        #   A `Google::Auth::Credentials` uses a the properties of its represented keyfile for
        #   authenticating requests made by this client.
        #   A `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to be used for the construction of
        #   credentials for this client.
        #   A `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to be used for the construction of
        #   credentials for this client.
        #   A `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
        #   A `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the RPC client. The channel credentials
        #   should already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
        #   A `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the Grpc channel. The proc transforms the
        #   metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
        # @param scopes [Array<String>]
        #   The OAuth scopes for this service. This parameter is ignored if
        #   an updater_proc is supplied.
        # @param client_config [Hash]
        #   A Hash for call options for each method. See
        #   Google::Gax#construct_settings for the structure of
        #   this data. Falls back to the default config if not specified
        #   or the specified config is missing data points.
        # @param timeout [Numeric]
        #   The default timeout, in seconds, for calls made through this client.
