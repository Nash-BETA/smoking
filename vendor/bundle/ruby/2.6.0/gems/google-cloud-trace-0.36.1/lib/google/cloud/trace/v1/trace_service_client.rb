          #   Multiple terms are ANDed. Syntax:
          #
          #   * `root:NAME_PREFIX` or `NAME_PREFIX`: Return traces where any root
          #     span starts with `NAME_PREFIX`.
          #   * `+root:NAME` or `+NAME`: Return traces where any root span's name is
          #     exactly `NAME`.
          #   * `span:NAME_PREFIX`: Return traces where any span starts with
          #     `NAME_PREFIX`.
          #   * `+span:NAME`: Return traces where any span's name is exactly
          #     `NAME`.
          #   * `latency:DURATION`: Return traces whose overall latency is
          #     greater or equal to than `DURATION`. Accepted units are nanoseconds
          #     (`ns`), milliseconds (`ms`), and seconds (`s`). Default is `ms`. For
          #     example, `latency:24ms` returns traces whose overall latency
          #     is greater than or equal to 24 milliseconds.
          #   * `label:LABEL_KEY`: Return all traces containing the specified
          #     label key (exact match, case-sensitive) regardless of the key:value
          #     pair's value (including empty values).
          #   * `LABEL_KEY:VALUE_PREFIX`: Return all traces containing the specified
          #     label key (exact match, case-sensitive) whose value starts with
          #     `VALUE_PREFIX`. Both a key and a value must be specified.
          #   * `+LABEL_KEY:VALUE`: Return all traces containing a key:value pair
          #     exactly matching the specified text. Both a key and a value must be
          #     specified.
          #   * `method:VALUE`: Equivalent to `/http/method:VALUE`.
          #   * `url:VALUE`: Equivalent to `/http/url:VALUE`.
          # @param order_by [String]
          #   Field used to sort the returned traces. Optional.
          #   Can be one of the following:
          #
          #   * `trace_id`
          #   * `name` (`name` field of root span in the trace)
          #   * `duration` (difference between `end_time` and `start_time` fields of
          #     the root span)
          #   * `start` (`start_time` field of the root span)
          #
          #   Descending order can be specified by appending `desc` to the sort field
          #   (for example, `name desc`).
          #
          #   Only one sort field is permitted.
          # @param options [Google::Gax::CallOptions]
